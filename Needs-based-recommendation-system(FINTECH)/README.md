### Needs-based recommendation systems
This is a project related to the use of classification machine learning methods.

In the excel file, there are all the clients of a bank with their features, and the bank is considering 
2 types of products: (1) IncomeInvestment products and (2) AccumulationInvestment products; and the clients
had already decided which types of product is the best for them.

The final goal of this project is to consider how the bank could choose which product to recommend to new clients,
and this is done through different classification machine learning methods, such as: AdaBoosting and Gradient Boosting;
Random forest classifier, Multi-Output classifier.
