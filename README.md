## Networked Software for Distributed Systems
#### Course description:
The primary objective of the course is for students to learn the fundamental abstractions and features of available networked software platforms while
gaining concrete practical experience on their use in diverse application scenarios. Specific domains covered in the course are the Internet of Things,
the Computing Continuum, Big Data Analytics, Concurrent Systems, Event-driven Applications, and High-performance Computing.
The course promotes a practical approach, as the explanation of system abstractions and features is tightly linked to their practical application.
The lecturers adopt a novel teaching methodology that enables students to invest most of their time with in-class lab sessions and hands-on work, with support from the lecturers.
