## Computational Statistics
#### Course description:
The course is organized in theoretical lectures and lab sessions. An additional project must be carried out in the form 5+3 CFU. Lectures will provide the theoretical background; practical Lab sessions will provide algorithms' implementation and examples of application of the considered methodologies by using basic Matlab codes.
