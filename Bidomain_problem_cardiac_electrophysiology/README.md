# DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHOD FOR THE BIDOMAIN PROBLEM OF CARDIAC ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY

In this project the aim is to simulate the cardiac electrophysiology phenomenon by considering a bidomain
equation coupled with the Fitz-Hugh Nagumo model. To capture the steep propagation front appearing in cardiac electro-physiology
simulations, DG methods of high order are considered in order to assess the
hyopthesis that a reduced number of degree of freedom are needed to have a good
accuracy with respect to the standare Finite Elements case.

In the repository you will find the implementation of the numerical method and the
report of the project

#### Example of simultation

Applied current at the center of the domain, horizontal fibers
